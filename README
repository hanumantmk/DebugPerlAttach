DebugPerlAttach
===============

This project is mostly possed of a script 'debug_perl' that can be used to wrap
up:

o attaching to the perl binary with gdb
o Running Enbugger in the attached process
  o Attaching to a locally running socat session

Thus our dependencies are:
o a debugging version of perl
o Enbugger
o socat

it's invoked as so: ./debug_perl PID

feel free to play, then 'continue' and ctrl+c

If you want to experiment, the accompanying ./test.pl prints it's pid, then simply loops
